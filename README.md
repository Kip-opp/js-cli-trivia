# CLI Trivia Game 🎮

A command-line interface (CLI) trivia game built with JavaScript. This application tests your knowledge of JavaScript concepts while demonstrating core programming features like asynchronous timers, array manipulation, and user input handling.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Interactive CLI:** Uses Node.js `readline` to accept user input directly in the terminal.
*   **Timed Gameplay:** You have a strict time limit (2 minutes) to complete the quiz using `setTimeout`.
*   **Immediate Feedback:** Get instant "Correct/Wrong" validation after every answer.
*   **Score Tracking:** Uses `filter()` to calculate your final score at the end.
*   **Dynamic Display:** Uses `map()` to format and display answer options cleanly.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** installed on your machine.
    *   To check if you have it, run: `node -v`
    *   If not, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## 📥 Installation

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```
    cd js-cli-trivia
